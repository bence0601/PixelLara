PixelLara
Welcome to PixelLara! This project aims to fill the gap in the world of web development by providing a fresh alternative to WordPress. While WordPress is undeniably popular, PixelLara offers a modern twist with C# for the backend and React for the frontend.

Why PixelLara?
If you're wondering why you should consider PixelLara over WordPress, here are a few reasons:

Faster Performance: By utilizing C# for the backend instead of PHP, PixelLara offers superior speed and efficiency.

Newer Technology: C# is a modern programming language with a strong ecosystem and support from Microsoft. It offers advanced features and tools for web development.

React Frontend: PixelLara leverages React for the frontend, providing a modern and dynamic user interface.

Multiple SQL Options: While WordPress primarily supports MySQL, PixelLara offers flexibility with multiple SQL databases, including support for PostgreSQL.
